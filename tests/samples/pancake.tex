\subsection{Ingredients}
\label{ingredients}

This is a pancake recipe that at the same time serves as \LaTeX test document. Put the following ingredients in a big bowl (make sure to add flour as last ingredient -- the order of the others is not important):

\begin{description}
\item[6 eggs] whithout shells but egg white and yolk together
\item[1 liter milk] the fresh one if possible with normal 3.5\% fat
\item[5~g salt] I hope you have a good scale or do such things often
\item[2 spoons of oil] use oil that's heat resistant like sun flower oil
\item[500~g flour] and pour it in while steering
\end{description}


\subsection{Baking}

Prepare the dough like discribed in section \ref{ingredients}.
Heat up a pan (use some oil if needed). Take a pan and put dough in such it covers the base. Wait approximately 1 to 2 minutes until the dough is no more fluid. Turn the pancake and bake the other side as well (approximately 1 minute). Continue until you have no more dough.


Some suggestions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tastes wonderfully with yoghurt and sugar
	\item Some people perfer jam
	\item Cheese, bakon and eggs are also an option but if you are in favor of those, put them already into the pan when you bake the second side of the pancake.
\end{itemize}

\emph{Enjoy your meal!}
