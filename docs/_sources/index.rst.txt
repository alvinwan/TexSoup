TexSoup documentation
===================================

TexSoup parses valid :math:`LaTeX` and provides a variety of BeautifulSoup-esque
methods and Pythonic idioms for iterating and searching the parse tree. Unlike
BeautifulSoup however, TexSoup is modeled after an interpreter, providing a set
of Pythonic structures for processing environments, commands, and arguments.
TexSoup only supports Python3.
